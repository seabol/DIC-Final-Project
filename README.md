## Advanced Encryption Standard -128 bits
### Introduction
Information security issues occur everywhere in modern society, for example, the password of online apps, the balance shown in your bank account, or the selfies stored in your social software. How to protect our personal information is worthy of discussion. In 2001, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in America announced the standard encryption scheme Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). It is widely used in every communication scenario in computer science, including private messages and data exchange. E.g., Secure Shell connections, Image Encryption, etc. Also, AES has several operation modes, including ECB, CBC, GCM, etc. However, in this practice, we neglect the variations of these modes, providing the pure AES-128 algorithm for implementing it. We expect that you could consider both the Area and Timing two criteria and design an AES-128 architecture for accelerating the provided algorithm.
